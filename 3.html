    Sonic the Hedgehog franchise logo
    Sonic the Hedgehog is a Japanese video game series and media franchise created and owned by Sega. The franchise follows Sonic, an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who battles Doctor Eggman, a mad scientist. In addition to video games, Sonic incorporates printed media, animations, a 2020 feature film, and merchandise. The first Sonic game, released for the Sega Genesis on June 23, 1991, was developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with Nintendo's mascot Mario. Sonic's success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the fourth generation of video game consoles in the early 1990s. When Sega exited the console market and shifted to third-party development in 2001, it continued the series on Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation systems. Sonic the Hedgehog is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the bestselling video game franchises, having sold more than 140 million copies by 2016. Several Sonic games have been listed among the greatest of all time. Although later games, notably the 2006 series reboot, have been criticized for a perceived decline in quality, Sonic is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture.

    Françoise-Marguerite de Sévigné	
    Françoise-Marguerite de Sévigné, comtesse de Grignan (1646–1705), was a French aristocrat. She is remembered for the letters that her mother, Madame de Sévigné, wrote to her over the course of thirty years. Françoise-Marguerite was a renowned beauty with a sharp wit, but was considered unbearably vain by Roger de Rabutin, comte de Bussy, another of her mother's correspondents. This oil-on-canvas portrait of the comtesse de Grignan was painted by Alexander Roslin in 1753, and is anachronistic in depicting her in mid-18th-century clothing.
